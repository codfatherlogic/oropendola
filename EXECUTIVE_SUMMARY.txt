CONCLUSION
==========

ROO CODE is a full-featured, production-ready AI code assistant with
enterprise-grade task management, context intelligence, and extensibility.

OROPENDOLA AI is a basic chat interface requiring 13-14 months of
development effort to reach feature parity with Roo Code.

For product decisions:
- If building a lightweight chat interface: Oropendola is appropriate
- If building a professional AI code assistant: Significant development needed
- If competing with Roo Code: 2,700+ hours of engineering work required
